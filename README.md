# CS182-Proj-GNNs

## Dataset:
The dataset is the hiv.csv in the root directory. It contains molecule
represented in SMILES strings (which we convert to graph in the code),
and binary labels, with 1 meaning it is active against HIV and 0
otherwise. The data is part of MoleculeNet, and the version of the 
datset we used is taken from the repo
"https://github.com/chemprop/chemprop/blob/master/chemprop/features/featurization.py"

from the Barzilay group, which is a cleaned-up version of the original
MoleculeNet dataset.
